Vmhook is an execution environment agnostic VMProtect 2 virtual machine hooking framework designed for hooking virtual machine handlers. The project only supports x64 VMProtect 2 binaries. An example usage of this project can be seen at [um-hook](https://githacks.org/vmp2/um-hook).

Hooking into the VMProtect 2 virtual machine of a kernel driver example can be found here: https://githacks.org/_xeroxz/vmhook-eac, multi-vm hooking can be seen here: https://githacks.org/_xeroxz/vmhook-eac/-/tree/multi-vm
